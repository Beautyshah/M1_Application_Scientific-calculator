## State of Art
### Feature Evolution
#### Early calculators
Humans first started using tools to count with the invention of the abacus, a tool that's so old that its exact origins have never
been confirmed. It involves moving a set of beads or balls from one side of a row of poles to another.
Around the mid 17th century, the first adding machine was invented. It was only capable of adding and subtracting by moving a set
of dials.
After that, a series of iterations on the adding machine advanced humanity toward the electronic calculators of today. This 
included Philip Hahn’s circular, hand-cranked calculator in 1778 and the first commercially produced calculator invented by Charles 
Xavier Thomas de Colmar in 1820.

#### Modern electronic calculators
Back in 1954, IBM came up with the first all-transistor calculator. Previous calculators had all used vacuum tubes to operate, but
this model used around 3,000 transistors instead. It was a large, bulky machine that could cost you up to $83,210.
Pretty soon, inventors began to produce far more compact versions of the modern calculator. In 1967, the first handheld calculator 
appeared on the scene. Since then, the basic interface of standard handheld calculators hasn’t changed much. It was released for
commercial sale in 1970, weighed 45 ounces and had ten numerical buttons from zero to nine.
The display was capable of showing digits up to 12 decimal places.
Today’s scientific calculators can perform a core set of calculations and functions. Different makes and models may also include 
extra features.

### What
A scientific calculator is a calculator designed to calculate science, engineering, and mathematics problems. It has way more buttons than standard calculator that just do four basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Why
Scientific calculator relieve the user  of the need to do mental operations and of the need to rely on paper, so far as possible.Scientific calculators are used widely in situations that require quick access to certain mathematical functions, especially those that were once looked up in mathematical tables, such as trigonometric functions or logarithms.The purpose of a calculator is to do correct calculations, and to do so efficiently.

### When
The first scientific calculator that included all of the basic ideas was the programmable Hewlett-Packard HP-9100A, released in 1968, though the Wang LOCI-2 and the Mathatronics Mathatron had some features later identified with scientific calculator designs.

### Where
Scientific calculators are used by engineers, surveyors, college students, scientists, and medical professionals. it is also used in shops to do calculations and also used in many other places.

### How
Scientific calculator will take input from the user such as logarithmic or trignometric and it will do its required operations internally and display its output on the screen.

## SWOT Analysis
### strengths
- It helps to solve very tedious and most difficult calculations.
- It is used by  engineers, surveyors, college students, scientists, and medical professionals.
- It allows to input a problem that has an order of operations.
- It is portable and easy to use machine.
- It gives accurate results.
- It gives output very quickly, in nanoseconds.
### weaknesses
- Dependency of people and make students lazy
- High cost 
- You need to take basic training to operate this device.
### Opportunities
- can be implemented in any places where calculations are required 
### Threats
- Other similar applications or device
