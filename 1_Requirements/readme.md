## State of Art
## Feature Evolution
#### Early calculators
Humans first started using tools to count with the invention of the abacus, a tool that's so old that its exact origins have never
been confirmed. It involves moving a set of beads or balls from one side of a row of poles to another.
Around the mid 17th century, the first adding machine was invented. It was only capable of adding and subtracting by moving a set
of dials.
After that, a series of iterations on the adding machine advanced humanity toward the electronic calculators of today. This 
included Philip Hahn’s circular, hand-cranked calculator in 1778 and the first commercially produced calculator invented by Charles 
Xavier Thomas de Colmar in 1820.

#### Modern electronic calculators
Back in 1954, IBM came up with the first all-transistor calculator. Previous calculators had all used vacuum tubes to operate, but
this model used around 3,000 transistors instead. It was a large, bulky machine that could cost you up to $83,210.
Pretty soon, inventors began to produce far more compact versions of the modern calculator. In 1967, the first handheld calculator 
appeared on the scene. Since then, the basic interface of standard handheld calculators hasn’t changed much. It was released for
commercial sale in 1970, weighed 45 ounces and had ten numerical buttons from zero to nine.
The display was capable of showing digits up to 12 decimal places.
oday’s scientific calculators can perform a core set of calculations and functions. Different makes and models may also include 
extra features.
